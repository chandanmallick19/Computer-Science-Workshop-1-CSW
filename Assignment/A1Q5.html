<p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life.
  There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.
  I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen.
  I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.
  I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.
  I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter.
  I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people.
  I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign.
  I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies.
  I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
